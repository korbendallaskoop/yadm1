Recently I read an article in How-to-Geek about changing from a resource-hungry distro (Ubuntu) to a resource-thrifty one (Manjaro) in order to speed up processing and require less support from a resource-challenged computer. It included this bash command to prove its point:

	systemctl list-unit-files --state=enabled --no-pager

heavyweight distro had 90 running daemons when idle, while Manjaro had only 24. I

just ran that command on a Solus Budgie VM that I'm currently running, and the result was 12! That suggests that the team has done a wonderful job of cutting out the unnecessary waste.

For anyone whos interested, here's the article: https://www.howtogeek.com/430556/why-i-switched-from-ubuntu-to-manjaro-linux/

https://discuss.getsol.us/d/2100-flatpak-or-snap/6
Which one do you prefer to use and works better for Solus at the moment according to your experience? I am concerned about Snap because Canonical (which is behind of it) contains Amazon ads and data leaks by default. What do you think about that?

I must say that I prefer Flatpak to Snaps all days of the year. I used Snaps in the beginning to get applications that weren't available in the repository. After a while I got tired of the instabilities of Snapd and figured I would move to something that is entirely open source like Flatpak. After using Flatpak I noticed that it feels way faster, the desktop integration is miles ahead and the flathub store is just wonderful. Flatpak also has the nice improvement of not having hardcoded icons which means that (if the icon local icon theme supports it, papirus-icon-theme does for example) you can use the local icon theme for the icons.

Flatpak just works great and much better than Snaps in my testing. My advice would be to use Snaps ONLY when an app isn't avaliable on flathub or any other repo. I have personally nuked everything that has to do with snaps on my computers in the hopes of it never coming back...f
